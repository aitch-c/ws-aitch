## Introduction

### Welcome

Welcome! Below you’ll find all slides and instructions for the hands-on activities being held today. This site and course will remain up after the event so you can refer back to the material later if you need to.

### Prerequisites

##### NativeScript

All attendees must have the NativeScript CLI installed, and all system requirements in place to develop for _either_ iOS or Android. For your reference the installation instructions can be found at the link below.

You should also be familiar with the CLI usage.

- [Complete the NativeScript installation guide](http://docs.nativescript.org/angular/start/quick-setup.html)

> **TIP**: If you run into issues completing the setup instructions, try [joining the NativeScript Slack](http://developer.telerik.com/wp-login.php?action=slack-invitation) and asking questions in the #getting-started channel.

##### Angular

You should be pretty comfortable with using the latest version of Angular. You don't need to know the ins and outs of Angular, but you should know how to use

- modules
- routing
- components
- directives
- pipes
- dependency injection with Angular
- services

##### TypeScript

It is required that you know TypeScript and are very comfortable with using it, you know, since Angular only uses TypeScript and all that. You should know how to use

- classes
- interfaces
- template literals
- object destructuring
- private constructors (used in the Singleton pattern)
- decorators
- types
  - union
  - intersection
  - enums
  - alias
  - nullable

##### Tools

Additionally, please also [download and install Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/download), and then [install the NativeScript extension for Visual Studio Code](https://docs.nativescript.org/tooling/visual-studio-code-extension#installation). You may be using NativeScript’s Visual Studio Code extension as you complete this guide.

### Project Downloads

The project files for this workshop can be downloaded from the link below. Download the archive below and decompress the file on your local machine.

There is one project folder in the included download:

- `ws-proj`

You will use this folder to get set up, and build on throughout the workshop.

The project has the start and end states of the code after each section. If you can't get a section working, and you need to move on, use one of the `start` folders as your starting point for the next chapter.

Navigate to the `ws-proj` folder to begin, and then open the project inside in VSCode.

Open the `nsconfig.json` file. Update the `appPath` value to point to the chapter and state (start or end) of the code that you need to run for a given section.
